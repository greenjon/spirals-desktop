# Spirals Desktop

Open source audio-reactive visual performance software for VJs.

## Status
🚧 Well developed beta. Most features work, the GUI is probably nearing its final form. 
Bugs will exist and bug reports are very welcome! Development is rapid and reported bugs will be fixed promptly.

## Tech Stack
- Kotlin/JVM
- LWJGL 3 (OpenGL)
- ImGui (UI)
- JACK Audio

## Roadmap & Active Tasks
- See `ROADMAP.md` for long-term project planning and completed milestones.
- See `TODO.md` for the list of active tasks and features currently under development.

## Building

```bash
./gradlew build
```

## Running

```bash
./gradlew run
```

## Packaging (Fat JAR)

To package the application and all its native library dependencies into a single distribution executable:

```bash
./gradlew shadowJar
```
The output will be generated under `build/libs/spirals-desktop-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar`.

## Real-Time Performance & JVM Tuning

For low-latency performance without audio glitches (xruns):
- The application uses **ZGC** (`-XX:+UseZGC`) and target pause times of 2ms (`-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=2`) to keep Garbage Collection stutters minimal.
- An OpenGL debug callback is registered via `GLDebug.setupDebugCallback()` in development, logging driver warnings/errors automatically.

## Audio Connection & Debugging (Linux)

You can manage the JACK audio connections using command line tools:
- `jack_lsp` - Lists active JACK audio/MIDI ports.
- `jack_connect <source> <destination>` - Establishes a patch connection.
- `pw-link` - Connection utility for PipeWire-JACK environments.
