# Spirals Desktop Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for **Spirals Desktop**, a real-time graphics and audio workstation designed for VJs and live visual performances.

Spirals combines real-time low-latency audio analysis, a CV modulation matrix, and high-performance generative visual rendering in a single desktop application.
